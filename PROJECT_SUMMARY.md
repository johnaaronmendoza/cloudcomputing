6. **Monitoring Service** (`monitoring-service:3005`)
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboard integration
   - Real-time analytics and insights
   - Service health monitoring

7. **Matching Engine** (`matching-engine:3006`)
   - AI-powered volunteer-senior pairing
   - Multi-factor matching algorithm
   - Skill, interest, and location-based matching
   - Engagement scoring and analytics

8. **Queue Service** (`queue-service:3007`)
   - Distributed job processing with Bull queues
   - RabbitMQ message queuing
   - Concurrency control and job scheduling
   - Background task processing

### Infrastructure & Databases

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database
